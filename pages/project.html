    <p>A portion of your grade will be assigned based on a quarter long project
involving analysis of the dynamics of a multibody system using Kane's method
and SymPy/PyDy. You must select a reasonably complex system (including possibly
significant damping and other interesting dynamic components). This is an ideal
opportunity to get started on the dynamic analysis of a thesis topic (with free
consulting!). Next you must suggest a set of well-posed questions about the
system which the simulation can help you to answer, derive the differential
equations of motion, study the system by simulating the system dynamics, and
present you results in a well formatted written report in the form of a
<a class="reference external" href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebook</a> (or set of) including whatever charts, tables, figures, and
visualizations you may need to clearly communicate your results.</p>
<p>Many students believe that once the equations are written and the simulation is
completed, the job is finished. Actually, the task has only begun. Dynamic
simulations are merely a tool to learn about the possible dynamic behaviors
that a system can exhibit and how these dynamics depend on other parameters.
They must be used cleverly and resourcefully to elucidate the behavior of the
system. This involves asking the right questions about the system and
understanding which parametric dependencies are of interest. Usually this will
come from some engineering job requirements and specifications or from some
scientific question which one would like answered (e.g. &quot;Design an antenna
deployment system for a communication satellite which works in the near earth
orbit, deploys in less that 10 sec, ..., etc.&quot; or &quot;What are the important
parameters which limit the maximum range of achievable in a throw of the discus
and how should it be launched optimally?&quot;). In this project you will be
responsible for generating this project requirement before writing the
simulation to help you answer the question you have asked. A good, precise
statement of an interesting question is every bit as important as good answer.
Indeed, poorly defined or worded questions are often impossible to answer in a
satisfying and fulfilling way.</p>
<p>Your grade will be based on the following aspects:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Sophistication, interest, and difficulty of system and the questions(s) you
will ask about it</li>
<li>Correctness of equations/analysis and interpretation</li>
<li>The cleverness and resourcefulness with which you use the simulation to
learn about the dynamics of the system and answer the questions posed</li>
<li>Your written discussion of the system and the presentation of the results of
your study/interpretation.</li>
<li>Clarity, coherence and general organization of your report</li>
</ol>

<p>Report to me in writing the system of your choice, including a motivation for
the problem, background on how to system works heuristically, a literature
search to identify previous work on this problem, and a relatively complete
discussion of the way you hope to use the dynamic simulation to learn what you
have chosen to learn. This should take several pages to do completely. I urge
you to begin the selection of your system immediately and to discuss it with me
office hours so that I can help you in this phase.</p>
